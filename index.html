            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <img src="assets/images/headshot (small & square).jpg" id="myPicture" alt="Thor Nolan">

            <p>I am an aspiring web developer living in the bay area, currently enrolled in UC Berkeley Extension's coding bootcamp and always looking for new ways to expand my coding skill set.</p> 
            
            <p>My interests include philosophy, technology, politics, writing, and gaming, but that's just to name a few, as I tend to find this world to be more than full of interesting things.</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not working on honing my coding skills, I enjoy rock climbing at my local climbing gym, or getting outside to climb or hike whenever I can. I am also an avid PC gamer, and have enjoyed building and updating the parts of my own PC for gaming as well as adding to my unreasonably large and ever-growing library of games.</p>
